<hr>

<p>
The validation of the reconstruction of non-uniform sampled (NUS) spectra is a powerful tool to assess the uncertainty introduced by the reconstruction methods introduced in <a href="reconstructionmethods.html">here</a> and, therefore, to be able to trust the results ad conclusions obtained from such spectra. This is especially useful (if not critical), when employing methods such as the constant-λ CAMERA reconstruction methods (see <a href="reconstructionmethods.html">here</a>), where parameter space can be substantial and no a priori criteria are known to choose such parameters.
</p>

<p>
The validation module allows the user to validate all input parameters given in the NUS reconstruction section. The <code>Lagrange multiplier</code> and <code>Background Parameter (log10)</code> fields are only enabled when the NUS HYSCORE data has been reconstructed with maxEnt methods and the <code>Threshold parameter</code> is only enabled when the IST methods are used. Note that the threshold parameter of the IST methods is not given as an input in Hyscorean since there it is always fixed at a value of 0.99. Nonetheless, this can be validated in here.

NOTE: <br>
The validation does not validate the reconstruction method. This is directly taken from the chosen method in the <code>NUS Reconstruction</code> section of the <code>Pre-Processing</code> panel in Hyscorean. If the method wants to be changed, the validation module needs to be closed and the method changed there before opening the module again.
</p>

<p>
The reconstruction methods are regularization methods and thus the results obtained via them have a dependency on the noise present in the measurement. Therefore, the validation module offers the chance to validate the noise effects on the results. Of course, it is not possible to change the innate noise in the signal but an upper bound can be assessed by adding additional white noise to the signal. Therefore, the field <code>Noise Level</code> determines the level of the added white noise relative to the signal maximum.
</p>

<p>
Another dependency of the results introduced by non-uniform sampling is the dependency on the NUS grid employed for the measurement. The program validates the sensibility of the reconstructed spectra to changes in sampling density. Again, it is impossible to validate sampling densities above the measured one, but a lower bound can be assessed by validating lower sampling densities. 
</p>

<p>
The <code>Sampling Density</code> field contains a slider whose values range from zero to the sampling density employed for the measurement and there the minimal value can be set for the validation. The program then constructs the linearly spaced vector with the number of elements given by Trials and values between the slider value and the experimental sampling density. To reach the validation sampling density the program randomly removes sampled points until the desired sampling density is reached.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
NOTE: <br>
Validation of the <code>Sampling Density</code> and <code>Background Parameter</code> fields can lead to substantial validation times, especially for low values. This must be considered when planning the number of trials.
