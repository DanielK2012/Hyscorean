<p>
One of the first steps to prepare for the fitting is to determine the magnetic field offset of the current measurement. This offset can be determined from a matrix peak on the HYSCORE spectrum from a known nuclear Larmor frequency. Hyscorean facilitates this procedure by including auxiliary lines which can be used for calibrating the field offset.<p> 
</p>

<p>
 These lines can be added from the <code>Add-Ons</code> panel on top of the main display, by pressing the <code>Add Auxiliary Line</code> button which will appear at the resonance frequency of the nuclei currently selected on the list box of the same panel. The user can also select the type of transition to be computed: single-quantum coherence (<code>SQC</code>), double-quantum coherence (<code>DQC</code>) or double double-quantum coherence  (<code>double DQC</code>). Depending on the coherence-type of choice the added dashed line will have a different color: black for SQC, red for DQC and blue for double DQC. The resonance frequency is computed by means of the gyromagnetic ratio of that nuclei, the magnetic field employed in the measurement and the magnetic field offset given by the <code>B-Field Offset</code> edit box in the same panel. All lines can be removed from the spectrum by means of the <code>Clear Lines</code> button.

Then to calibrate the magnetic field offset one can adjust its value via the <code>B-Field Offset</code> edit box and add a new line. The offset value corresponds to that at which the line crosses the center of the matrix peak, e.g. proton matrix peaks. The value can be fine-tuned by zooming in the corresponding matrix peak and adding the line:
