<p>
Once Hyscorean is done with the pre-processing and processing the resulting signal is Fourier transformed via Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) to the corresponding HYSCORE spectrum. This is then plotted as a magnitude contour plot (per default) on the main display. During the rendering of the spectrum, all GUI elements are disabled so that the user cannot overload the number of spectra to plot. This is denoted by the status message <code>Rendering…</code></p>

<p>
As visual guides, dashed lines are always displayed along the diagonal and anti-diagonal as well as a solid line along the first dimension’s zero frequency. Additionally, the <code>Zoom-In</code> and <code>Zoom-Out</code> buttons are activated to allows the user to zoom in and out of the HYSCORE spectrum as in normal MATLAB figures. 
</p>

<p>
At this point the user may change the appearance of the spectrum via the now activated <code>Graphics</code> panel:

<p>
<code>I.</code>	The <code>Axis Frequency Limit</code> edit box sets the maximal absolute frequency to which the spectrum is plotted (on its zoomed-out state) and given in megahertz. This value is later passed on to any other function which plots a HYSCORE spectrum of any kind.
</p>

<p>
<code>II.</code>	Due to noise, contour plots can become crowded with many lines, obscure some features or just not be aesthetically appealing. This can be changed by setting the lowest contour level to a certain percentage of the maximal intensity. The contour levels are then equidistantly constructed between this lowest level and the highest value. Anything below/above that minimal/maximal value is not plotted as a contour. This percentage value is given by the user in the <code>Min-Max Contour Level</code> edit box. Setting the minimum level to 0% will use the minimum in the spectrum.

<code>III.</code> The spectrum can be detached into a separate new window by pressing one of the detach buttons on this group. Once detached the spectrum can be saved or copied just as normal MATLAB figures. Hyscorean spectra can be detached into three different formats: <code>contour</code> (just as in the GUI), <code>surface</code> (3D-surface with color bar) and <code>projection</code> (contour plot with inset displaying a skyline projection along each axis).

NOTE: <br>
Any changes made in the <code>Graphics</code> panel will result in an automatic update of the spectrum with the updates settings. This is again notified by the status message: <code>Rendering…</code>. Depending on the settings and the graphics capabilities of the computer, the rendering times once the <code>Graphical Settings</code> window is closed can become substantial (see later).
