<p>
Hyscorean offers the possibility to comfortably process non-uniform sampled (NUS) HYSCORE experimental data. Nonetheless, the acquisition of such data can be a challenge with the hardware and software commonly available to perform HYSCORE experiments. Of course, home-built spectrometers which run on home-built software are easy to adapt to NUS measurements. Implementation is also commonly easy due to the programming languages this are built upon. 
</p>

<p>
Commercial Bruker spectrometers running on the XEPR software are not able to perform NUS measurements of any kind due to their sweep-experiment nature. Nonetheless, to allow NUS HYSCORE to be applied as widely as able Hyscorean offers an add-on as a possibility to measure NUS HYSCORE in commercial Bruker machines. 
</p>

<p>
In the following sections a description will be provided on how this is achieved, as well as a detailed guide to set up NUS HYSCORE measurements on Bruker spectrometers running on XEPR.
