<p>
The implementation of non-uniform sampling and spectral reconstruction represents a powerful experimental technique to reduce measurement times of HYSCORE experiments. The reconstruction methods available in Hyscorean (see <a href="recosntructionmethods.html">here</a>) also represent a flexible framework to reconstruct the spectra.  Nonetheless, these methods introduce not only a certain number of parameters but also an uncertainty into the spectrum which the user may not feel comfortable with. This uncertainty can have many origins such as the sampling density of the NUS schedule, the noise in the signal, reconstruction parameters or background correction. Also, the fact that spectral reconstruction is based on regularization methods makes it not immediately intuitive.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, Hyscorean offers the possibility to validate the HYSCORE spectra by validating all the factors which give raise to uncertainty. Validation is nothing more than a statistical error analysis that allows the user to get an estimate or measure of the uncertainty of the different regions in the spectrum by defining the uncertainty in the different parameters. It generates a set of HYSCORE spectra from different sets of parameters and then performs a simple statistical analysis of the obtained spectra to give different measures such as mean as well as upper and lower bound spectra. 
</p>

<p>
The validation of HYSCORE spectra is not only useful to assess uncertainty of NUS HYSCORE spectra but can also be used to check the influence of the background correction parameters on normal HYSCORE spectra.

<p>
In Hyscorean the validation module can be started from the <code>Validation</code> button in the <code>Pre-Processing</code> panel. The button will only become active once the data has been processed for the first time. Pressing the button will prompt the validation module GUI to appear:

<p>
Depending on the type of data being processed (uniform or non-uniform sampled) different UI control elements will be disabled, meaning that the parameters they represent are of no relevance for the validation of the current data.

The following sections will cover the basics of Hyscorean’s validation of background correction and NUS reconstruction.
