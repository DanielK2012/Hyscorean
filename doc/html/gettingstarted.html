<p>
Thank you for downloading Hyscorean (i.e. HYSCORE analysis), a free software for the processing and manipulation of experimental HYSCORE spectra controlled via a graphical user-interface. Hyscorean enables the processing of uniform and non-uniform sampled HYSCORE experiments, background fitting, reconstruction of the signals, signal processing, validation and fitting of the spectra using EasySpin. Therefore, Hyscorean takes care of everything from the raw HYSCORE data to the fitted results ready for interpretation. This user-guide describes all elements, procedures and tricks in Hyscorean so that the user can exploit all the features available.
 </p>

<p>
Processing of NUS HYCORE data is irrelevant if the measurements are impossible with common commercial spectrometers. Therefore, Hyscorean offers the possibility to measure NUS HYSCORE with commercial Bruker spectrometers. This manual also provides a guide to setting up such measurements as well as the source code for the measurement programs.

I want to acknowledge Stefan Stoll and Bradley Worley for their open-source policies on the source code of their software: EasySpin and CAMERA, respectively, which have allowed Hyscorean to reach this state.

Enjoy processing with Hyscorean, <br>
