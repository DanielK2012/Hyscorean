<p>
An additional feature of Hyscorean’s fitting module is the possibility to fit the experimental spectrum with a simulation obtained using the spin Hamiltonian parameters computed by the ORCA quantum chemistry program system. One of the outputs generated by ORCA is a binary file that contains the atomic coordinates and all calculated spin system properties.
</p>


<p>
To perform such a simulation with the fitting module the user can press the <code>ORCA</code> button next to the <code>Parameters</code> table. This will prompt an OS window to appear where the binary <code>.prop</code> ORCA output file can be selected. Once the file is selected, Easyspin will load the data from the file and Hyscorean will then display list with all the atoms contained in the ORCA calculation. The indices displayed along each atom in the list are the same indices assigned in the ORCA output files.

<p>
The user can choose one or several atoms to be included in the simulation just by selecting them on the list and pressing the <code>OK</code> button. The spin system will be constructed according to the nuclei selected and sent to Easyspin to be simulated with saffron, which will be monitored by a message window displaying: “Simulating ORCA system...”. 
</p>

<p>
If the simulation is completed successfully the resulting simulation will be updated in the main display in a similar fashion as in the previous section. Again, to better differentiate the nature of the fit spectrum in the current display, all ORCA simulation results are displayed in a different color coding. For the ORCA data the fitted spectrum is a colormap using orange colors. As in the other cases, the simulation will be processed using the same settings as for the experimental spectrum.

<p>
Since the spin system definition and all parameters are given from an outer source, when the simulated spectrum is displayed no changes will be done to the <code>Parameters</code> table. If another fit (either normal fit or manual) is started, the spin system will be taken again from the definition in <code>System</code> and undergo as usual. The ORCA simulation feature is just for display and quick comparison of the ORCA simulations with the experimental spectra.
