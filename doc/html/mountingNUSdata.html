<div class="functitle">Mounting NUS Data</div>
<hr>

<p>
The main change in the mounting procedures is the fact that the input data does not contain all points of a Nyquist grid. Therefore, the mounting now must extract the NUS grid from the measured t1 and t2 timings. From the NUS grid and the timings, the signal can be piecewise constructed from the data obtained from the measurements to obtain the NUS HYSCORE signal.

<p>
For NUS data, Hyscorean does allow the same input data formats as for uniform sampled data (i.e. DTA, DSC, mat, txt, ...). Nonetheless, the way the mounting is performed is slightly different for each of these formats and are, thus, briefly described in the following.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Mounting NUS Bruker BES3T data</div>

<p>
Hyscorean automatically recognizes HYSCORE data obtained from commercial Bruker spectrometer data in BES3T data formats (DSC and DTA). This data can be obtained as described <a href="xeprprinciple.html">here</a> NUS measurements on Bruker XEPR spectrometers and then loaded into Hyscorean as usual via the <code>Load</code> button. 
</p>

<p>
The software recognizes that it is NUS data due to the DSC or DTA files containing only one-dimensional data and not two-dimensional data as is the case for uniform-sampled BES3T data. The t1- and t2-timings are then extracted from the abscissa according to the encoding described <a href="xeprprinciple.html">here</a>  and the effective dwell times for each dimension are determined. 
</p>

<p>
The empty NUS grid is then constructed from the effective dwell time and the maximal measured timing along each dimension. The sampled NUS grid points are then filled according to the t1/t2-timings combinations present in the abscissa of the DSC or DTA file. 
</p>

<p>
The measured signal points are then extracted from the ordinate an arranged in a fashion similar to how the data was mounted for the uniform-sampled case (see <a href="mounting.html">here</a> ) where now all non-measured points are set to NaN-values. The τ-values employed during the experiments are extracted from the DSC or DTA file descriptors. It is important that the τ-values are defined in the CMTS parameter as described <a href="xeprprinciple.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once the NUS data has been mounted, all different τ-values and their possible combinations will be updated as usual for the user to choose from the <code>Tau-selection</code> list box.
</p>

<div class="subtitle"> Mounting NUS ASCII Data </div>

<p>
The program takes the same ASCII data input files as <a href="mounting.html">before</a> and checks whether the dwell time between all measured points is the same. If not, the data is identified as non-uniform and the NUS grid is constructed as in the previous section. 
</p>
<p>
The empty NUS grid is constructed from the effective dwell time and the maximal measured timing along each dimension and the sampled NUS grid points are filled according to the t1/t2-timings combinations present in the corresponding ASCII columns. As <a href="mounting.html">before</a> the program identifies the different τ -values employed for the measurement and then constructs the NUS signals from the ASCII columns with the help of the NUS grid.
