In this new step, the NUS signal must be reconstructed:

</center>

<p>
Due to the non-uniform nature of the measurement, the Fourier transform of NUS signals no longer corresponds to an expansion in an orthonormal Fourier basis set and therefore is not a transform anymore in a strict sense [7].  However, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the zero-augmented NUS signal still is possible and leads to a spectrum which in Hyscorean is referred to as the nuDFT (non-uniform DFT) spectrum.
</p>

<p>
The nuDFT spectrum is the convolution of the uniformly sampled spectrum with the point-spread function (PSF) of the sampling grid, which can be obtained by Fourier transformation of the sampling grid. The reconstruction methods aim to deconvolve the PSF from the spectrum via regularization. This procedure is equivalent to reconstructing the missing points in the NUS signal.

During the data mounting Hyscorean will recognize if the data are NUS and will activate the <code>NUS Reconstruction</code> section in the <code>Pre-processing</code> panel:

<p>
The user can select a reconstruction method from the list. These can be categorized into two reconstruction families: maximum entropy (maxEnt) and iterative soft thresholding (IST) reconstruction. Depending on whether the selected method requires any additional input parameters, the corresponding elements in the GUI will be activated or deactivated
</p>

<p>
The following sections will provide a brief description on the reconstruction methods available on Hyscorean and their way of action.	
</p>


<div class="subtitle">Iterative Soft-Thresholding (IST) reconstruction</div>

<p>
An l<sub>1</sub>-based regularization method based on the compressed-sensing principle, that through optimization, the sparsity of a signal can be exploited to recover it from fewer samples than required by the Nyquist theorem [8]. This method regularizes a spectrum <b><i>X</i></b> that minimizes the functional
</p>

<center>
<img src= "eqn/istfunctional.png", width="40%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
where <b><i>b</i></b> is the measured experimental signal, <b><i>D</i></b> is the NUS grid and <b><i>F</i></b> is the inverse Fourier transform kernel. This functional is solved by iterative soft-thresholding, which iteratively updates the solution <b><i>X</i></b> with all values in <b><i>F</i></b><sup>-1</sup><b><i>b</i></b> (i.e. the nuDFT spectrum) larger than the threshold value <i>η</i>.
</p>

<ol>
<li> 	The threshold is set to &eta; = <font face="Symbol">&tau;</font> <font face="Symbol">|</font>max(<b><i>F</i></b><sup>-1</sup><b><i>b</i></b>)<font face="Symbol">|</font>, where <font face="Symbol">&tau;</font> is the damping factor.

<li> 	The solution <b><i>X</i></b> is updated with all values in <b><i>F</i></b><sup>-1</sup><b><i>b</i></b> larger than the threshold &eta;. 

<li> 	The input signal <b><i>b</i></b> is updated by subtracting the term <b><i>DFX</i></b> or <b><i>(1-D)FX</i></b>.

<li> 	The updated spectrum <b><i>F</i></b><sup>-1</sup><b><i>b'</i></b> will contain all artifacts and less meaningful peaks. 

<li> 	The threshold is updated to&eta; = <font face="Symbol">&tau;</font> <font face="Symbol">|</font>max(<b><i>F</i></b><sup>-1</sup><b><i>b'</i></b>)<font face="Symbol">|</font>  and the next iteration is started. 

<li> 	After sufficient iterations the solution <b><i>X</i></b> will contain meaningful peaks but no artifacts.

</ol>

<p>
Two variants of this algorithm have been developed:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code> IST-D </code>
<p> 
In Drori’s IST (IST-D) the term <b><i>DFX</i></b> is subtracted from <b><i>b</i></b> and hence the measured points in <b><i>b</i></b> are updated and non-measured points in <b><i>b</i></b> are left to zero. This allows for the algorithm to find a balance between data agreement and sparsity in the solution.
</p>
<li> <code> IST-S </code>
<p> 
In Stern’s IST (IST-S) the term <b><i>(1-D)FX</i></b> is subtracted from <b><i>b</i></b> and hence non-measured points in <b><i>b</i></b> are updated and measured points in <b><i>b</i></b> are left unchanged. This enforces a strict accordance between the reconstruction and the measured data.
</p>
</ul>

<p>
Due to the thresholding nature of the IST methods, the intensity response of the reconstructed spectrum is linear with respect to that of the experimental data. In Hyscorean both IST-D and IST-S can be chosen by the user as reconstruction methods. In both cases the damping factor <font face="Symbol">&tau;</font> is set to 0.99 and updated after each iteration <i>k</i>  according to
</p>

</center>

which enhances the convergence speed of the algorithm. Nonetheless, the damping factor can be later validated via Hyscorean’s validation module (see <a href="validationNUS.html">here</a>). 

<hr>
<p>
NOTE: <br>
Due to the thresholding nature of these algorithms, in cases with strongly pronounced PSF’s (due to e.g. low sampling densities or low randomness) the sampling artifacts may be so pronounced that these lie at the level of true peaks and be incorporated into the solution via the thresholding. In such cases, IST-S and IST-D may not be able to recover any more signal and the use of maxEnt methods are recommended.
</p>
<hr>

<div class="subtitle"> Maximum Entropy (maxEnt) reconstruction</div>

<p>
Maximum entropy (maxEnt) methods aim to find the spectrum that has minimal statistical information content (i.e. maximum entropy), while still maintaining agreement with the measured data. This is achieved by regularization of the reconstructed spectrum <b><i>X</i></b> via minimization (by discrepancy principle) of functionals of the form
</p>

<center>
<img src= "eqn/maxentfunctional1.png", width="65%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
where again <b><i>b</i></b> is the measured experimental NUS signal, <b><i>D</i></b> is the NUS grid, <b><i>F</i></b> is the inverse Fourier transform kernel and ε is the noise level in the signal. The Lagrange multiplier λ controls the balance between the data agreement imposed by the first term in the functional and the entropy penalty. Therefore, depending on the choice of λ the intensity response of MaxEnt methods varies:
</p>

<ul>
<li> 	<code>Small λ</code>	 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	Non-linear intensity response of the reconstructed spectrum.
<li>	<code>Large λ</code>	 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	Linear intensity response of the reconstructed spectrum.
</ul>

<p>
The effects of non-linearity can be observed in the following example:
</p>

<center>
<img src= "img/nusprocessing5.png", width="95%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
As the non-linearity increases the relative scaling of the peaks in the reconstructed spectrum becomes more drastic so that even true peaks are removed from the spectrum leaving only the most intensive ones. This does however not mean that non-linearity is to be avoided since it allows MaxEnt to recover the true spectrum from the noise and sampling artifacts (see below).
</p>

<p>
The term <i>S(<b><i>X</i></b>)</i> represents the spectral entropy and in Hyscorean this is implemented with the Hoch-Hore entropy [9]
</p>

<center>
<img src= "eqn/maxentfunctional2.png", width="55%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
which is monotonous in contrast to the Shannon and Skilling entropies as well as insensitive to the phase of the signal. The parameter δ is the so-called background parameter, which to a large extent determines the threshold at which the non-linear effects become significant. It can also be described to control the curvature of the maxEnt functionals, leading to smoother/rougher reconstructions. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> 	<code>Small &eta;</code>	 <br>
		Smooth, slow converging functional (i.e. long computation times). Smoother and generally more accurate reconstructions

<li>	<code>Large &eta;</code>	 <br>
		Rough functional (i.e. short computational times) but with divergence risk. Artifacts start to populate the reconstruction

</ul>

<div class="subtitle">Fast-forward maxEnt (FFM) reconstruction</div>

<p>
This maxEnt method represents the limiting case of the previous functional when λ→∞, which enforces a strict accordance with the measured data. Thus, experimental measured points are directly set into the reconstruction and only the missing points are reconstructed. These are reconstructed via entropy gradient methods which in Hyscorean are called:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>FFM-CG</code> <br>
Employs the conjugate gradient method to reconstruct the missing points.
<li> <code>FFM-GD</code> <br>
Employs the gradient descent method to reconstruct the missing points. 
</ul>

<p>
One advantage of this method is the absence of the Lagrange multiplier which the reduces to parameter space to just the background parameter η for the entropy. In Hyscorean this can be given as a logarithmic value in the <code>Background Param. (log10)</code> edit box. However, the FFM methods are known to over-fit noise at low SNR signals.
</p>

<div class="subtitle">Convex Accelerated MaxEnt Reconstruction Algorithm (CAMERA)</div>

<p>
CAMERA is a new approach to spectral reconstruction that exhibits fast, tunable convergence in both constant-aim and constant-lambda mode [9]. Hyscorean allows the operation of CAMERA on both modes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <code>constant-aim CAMERA</code> 
<p>
On this mode CAMERA employs Nesterov’s accelerated first-order convex optimization method where the Lagrange multiplier is iteratively updated according to
</p>
<center>
<img src= "eqn/maxentfunctional3.png", width="60%", class="center">
</center>
<p>
where L is a Lipschitz constant which depends on the background parameter η. Also, the reconstruction at iteration t is updated taking into consideration the solutions in the previous iterations in order to generate a momentum which allows the algorithm to reach the optimum solution faster than other optimization methods:
</p>
<center>
<img src= "eqn/maxentfunctional4.png", width="35%", class="center">
</center>
<p>
where <b><i>Y</i><sub>t-1</sub></b> is the proximal gradient mapping step given by
</p>
<center>
<img src= "eqn/maxentfunctional5.png", width="60%", class="center">
</center>
<p>
and the Lipschitz constant is also updated iteratively according to <i>L</i> ← min(<i>2L,(2η)<sup>-1</sup></i>).
</p>

<li> <code>constant-λ CAMERA</code> 
<p>
On this mode CAMERA does not update the Lagrange multiplier as before but fixes it to a user-defined value. This mode allows the user to control the non-linearity of the maxEnt reconstruction manually and to impose more de-noising of the spectrum.
</p>
</ul>

<p>
Constant-aim CAMERA performs in a similar way as the FFM methods (as well as IST) and reconstructs the spectrum as well as in the uniform sampled case for moderate or good PSF (i.e. moderate sampling densities or good SNR). Nonetheless, constant-λ CAMERA allows the user to impose even further regularization onto the spectrum resulting in a de-noising effect. Also, in cases when the other reconstruction methods may fail, constant-λ CAMERA can still reconstruct the true spectrum by proper choice of the combination of background parameter and Lagrange multiplier.
</p>

<center>
<img src= "img/nusprocessing6.png", width="95%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
Constant-aim CAMERA tends to set the Lagrange multiplier to large values setting the reconstruction in a highly linear regime (meaning that even the noise level is reconstructed). However, constant-λ CAMERA can set the algorithm into a highly non-linear regime which is necessary if the artifacts in the nuDFT spectrum are too large.
