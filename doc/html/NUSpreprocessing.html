<div class="functitle">NUS HYSCORE Pre-Processing</div>
<hr>

<p>
The main difference between “standard” HYSCORE processing and NUS HYSCORE processing is the fact that an additional reconstruction step must be incorporated. Once the NUS signal is reconstructed all remaining steps for the processing remain unchanged. Nonetheless, small differences arise during other steps of the pre-processing and will be handled in the following sections.
</p>

<div class="subtitle"> NUS Background Correction </div>

<p>
Once the NUS data has been mounted, the multiple signals measured at different τ-values are combined according to the user input. At this point the signal is zero-augmented and must be background corrected. Due to these artificially inserted zeros, a try to fit the background from the data would be ill-posed leading to wrong background fits. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, to avoid this, the zeros introduced by zero-augmentation are converted to NaN values and then background corrected. MATLAB fit functions are programed to ignore any NaN values from the data being fitted. Thus, only the measured signal points are fitted and then background corrected.

<p>
Once the background has been corrected, the NaN values in the signal are returned to zeros to give the background-corrected and zero-augmented NUS signal. 
</p>

<p>
NOTE: <br>
As the number of points in the traces get lower, the fitted backgrounds may start to behave strange or even look unphysical. This is, however, not an issue since the fit between the few points is actually good. For the non-measured points, it does not matter how the background is fitted since they are set to NaN and remain so even when a strange background is subtracted from them.
