<!-- =========================================================== -->
<div class="subtitle">Zero-Filling</div>

<p>
The processing starts by zero-filling the pre-processed signal (i.e. appending a certain number of zeros to the end of the signal). By default, the program automatically sets this number to the dimensions of the signal so that the full information of the signal is recovered later in the Fourier transform. Any further zeros can be appended by modifying the <code>Zero-filling</code> edit boxes in the <code>Processing</code> panel for aesthetic changes. The zero-filling can be disabled by setting the values in the edit boxes to zero. However, this is not recommended due to the consequent loss of information.
</p>

<!-- =========================================================== -->
<div class="subtitle">Lorentz-to-Gauss Transformation</div>
<p>
Exponentially decaying time-domain signals such as in HYSCORE correspond to Lorentzian line shapes in frequency domain. The Lorentzian line shapes are characteristic for having long tails which can become very damaging in 2D-spectra such as HYSCORE’s due to possible overlaps between crosspeak tails appearing as spurious crosspeaks.
</p>

<p>
The Lorentz-to-Gauss transformation (also known as Gaussian multiplication or double exponential transformation) allows to convert the Lorentzian line shape to the Gaussian line shape which exhibits narrower tails . Therefore, such overlaps between crosspeak tails can be avoided. This transformation is achieved by applying the following window to the signal.

<p>
where the parameters in Hyscorean are computed as:
</p>

<p>
The factors σ_i and τ_i can be given through Hyscorean‘s <code>Processing</code> panel in the the <code>Sigma1</code>/<code>Sigma2</code> and <code>Tau1</code>/<code>Tau2</code> edit boxes. By default, Lorentz-to-Gauss transformation is disabled in Hyscorean until the corresponding <code>Lorentz-to-Gauss Transformation</code> check box is enabled.
</p>

<p>
This technique allows the resolution densely populated regions of the spectra where many closely spaced peaks overlap with each other and with their tails. The values for the Lorentz-Gauss transformation are usually found in a trial-and-error approach and often not all parts of a spectrum can be equally well-resolved. The defaults given in Hyscorean ensure a strong cancellation of the signal decay.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: <br>
While applying Lorentz-to-Gauss transformations one must make sure that the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough and that after transformation the apodization of the signal (see next section) is still working properly to avoid truncation artifacts.
</p>
<hr>

<!-- =========================================================== -->
<div class="subtitle">Apodization</div>

<p>
If the signal has not decayed fully to zero at the time the measurement finishes, the so-called truncation artifacts will appear in frequency-domain. This can be avoided by applying an apodization function (also called window function) which induces an artificial decay of the signal. This function suppresses the sidelobes leakage at the expense of a broadening of the lines resulting in decreased resolution. Hyscorean offers several different apodization windows which can be selected through the <code>Apodization</code> list box in the <code>Processing</code> panel: 
</p>

<center>

</center>

<p>
The program also allows the user to give the number of points after which the apodization window has decayed completely in each dimension as an input. This allows to generate asymmetric apodization windows in case one dimension needs to be more suppressed than the other. These values are first automatically set to the dimensions of the signal after its mounting and can be later modified in the <code>Window Length</code> edit boxes near the window selection list box. If the window length along any of the dimensions exceed or are inferior to the signal dimensions, the apodization window is truncated or zero-filled, respectively. At any point apodization can be disabled and skipped by selecting the <code>None</code> options from the list box (not recommended).
</p>

<p>
A good measure for the capabilities of an apodization window in suppressing sidelobes is the primary sidelobe suppression. The sidelobe suppression can be measured from the Fourier transform of the apodization window itself. For the non-apodised cases, the signal is truncated via a rectangular function, whose primary sidelobe is suppressed by about 13.2dB relative to the main frequency. This level introduces the serious artifacts mentioned previously, which can be cured via apodization:

<p>
Nonetheless, this is at the cost of broadening, which can also be measured from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the main frequency lobe of the Fourier transform of the apodization window [4]. The following graphs show the primary sidelobe suppression capabilities and broadening of all windows offered by Hyscorean
</p>

<center>
<img src= "img/signalprocessing5.png", width="70%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
where strong sidelobe suppression comes at the cost of strong broadening of the signal peaks. Thus, the choice of apodization window can be made by finding a compromise between the broadening of the signal crosspeaks and the primary sidelobe suppression induced by the apodization. The user must decide where to set in this compromise and check for an optimal balance. Such an optimization (which is quickly performed) can result in strong changes in spectra with heavily populated regions.
</p>

<!-- =========================================================== -->
<div class="subtitle">Spectral Symmetrization</div>

<p>
Thanks to the nature of the HYSCORE experiment, the obtained spectra are highly symmetric. All crosspeaks in HYSCORE spectra are symmetric along the diagonal and anti-diagonal for the strong and weak coupling quadrants, respectively.  
</p>

<p>
This symmetry can be exploited to reduce artifacts arising from different sources, such as noise, background correction or non-uniform sampling. These artifacts are in nature not symmetric. Therefore, enforcing the symmetry of HYSCORE spectra via processing is a powerful tool to get rid of such “asymmetric” artifacts or at least to reduce them to noise level. This can be done by symmetrizing HYSCORE spectra along their diagonal, anti-diagonal or both.
</p>

<center>
<img src= "img/signalprocessing6.png", width="80%", class="center">
</center>

<p>
The symmetrization along the diagonal is performed via the following matrix operation
</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>
and for the antidiagonal symmetrization, where Λ is a geometrical operator which flips the matrix left to right
</p>
<center>
<img src= "eqn/symmetrization2.png", width="25%", class="center">
</center>

<hr>
<p>
NOTE: 
<br>
In order for the geomtrical average to work, the spectra must be square matrices. Hence, if symmetrization is employed, Hyscorean will force the time-domain signal to be a square matrix. This is done by zero-filling the smallest dimension until both dimensions are equal. The the changes will be automatically updated in the <code>Zero-Filling</code> edit boxes.
</p>
<hr>

<p>
The symmetrization can be selected from the <code>Spectral Symmetrization</code> list box. There, diagonal and anti-diagonal symmetrization can be selected as well as the option to perform both symmetrization sequentially.

<hr>
<p>
NOTE: 
<br>
Symmetrization can also introduce fake crosspeaks, in case two crosspeaks have intense tails that extend a wide range of the spectrum. The user is recommended to compare the result with the normal spectrum and to judge the results.
