<p>
To install Hyscorean and set up all the environment variables required by the software to work the following instructions need to be followed: 
<p> 
I.	First all files must be extracted from the ZIP file (downloaded from the EPR@ETH homepage or from the official GitHub server) and saved on a directory/folder of choice. 
</p>
<p>
 II.	Open MATLAB and change the current path to the Hyscorean installation folder. It is NOT necessary to add all Hyscorean files to the MATLAB path search.
 </p>
<p>
III.	Execute the script <code>setup_hyscorean</code> from the MATLAB console and wait until execution finishes. This installation program will take care setting up everything necessary in MATLAB for Hyscorean to work properly. More precisely it takes care of the following: 
<ul>
<li>	All required paths by Hyscorean are saved into the path search of MATLAB for further sessions.
<li>	The installation and license of required MATLAB & Simulink packages are controlled and the functionality of Hyscorean is adapted to missing packages.
<li>	The proper installation of EasySpin is controlled and again the functionality of Hyscorean is adapted if missing or not installed. 
<li>	Default user-preferences are set in the MATLAB preferences to allow Hyscorean to keep user-defined defaults between sessions. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Before these actions are taken the user must agree to the terms of the GNU LGPL 3.0 3.0 license agreement which appears at the start of the setup.
</p>

<p>
By pressing the button <code>Agree</code>, the license is admitted, and the setup proceeds as described. Otherwise, Hyscorean cannot be used until the license agreement is accepted.
</p>

<p>
IV.	Once the setup program finishes the setup a message will be printed on the console to indicate the outcome of the installation.
A successful installation is indicated by the message:
<pre class="matlab">
Hyscorean was successfully and fully installed and all functionalities are operational.
</pre>
Indicating that the installation proceeded smoothly without any problems and that Hyscorean is ready to be used.
In case some of the external packages is not available these will be individually notified during the installation and once finishes will be indicated by the message:
<pre class="matlab">
Hyscorean was successfully but incompletely installed.
</pre>
</p>
<!-- =========================================================== -->
<div class="subtitle">Starting the program</div>
<p>
Once installation is finished, Hyscorean can be called from any path in MATLAB by executing the command <code>Hyscorean</code> from the console. This will prompt the Hyscorean graphical user-interface (GUI) to appear:
</p>

<center>
<img src="img/hyscorean_main.png", width = "100%">
</center>
<p>
At this point most of the user-interface controls will be either deactivated or not visible. As a general feature of Hyscorean, the program will activate and deactivate buttons on the GUI according to what the user can and cannot do at that moment. This prevents the user from doing any action which would lead to a crash or error.
