<div class="functitle">Basic HYSCORE Processing</div>
<hr>


<p>
This section presents the basics of Hyscorean to get from the mounted HYSCORE signal to a processed spectrum. The processing is divided into two clear blocks: the pre-processing and the processing part. The parameters to be set by the user are separated into two different panels (which are activated once the mounting finished) in the Hyscorean GUI:

<p>
Hyscoreanâ€™s processing protocol is started by pressing the <code>Process</code> button

<p>
and then follows this structure:

<p>
To enhance the processing times of Hyscorean a series of switches are employed at each step of the pre-processing. Once the <code>Process</code> button is pressed and the processing finishes, all switches are activated and pressing the <code>Process</code> button again will result in the pre-processing being skipped. This allows to avoid performing computationally costly procedures such as background correction or NUS reconstruction (which is always skipped for non-NUS signals) when there are only changes in the processing part. If any of the parameters in the <code>Pre-processing</code> panel is modified the corresponding switches will be deactivated and the processing will start at that point of the pre-processing.
</p>

<p>
The steps of the pre-processing which have been finished and will be skipped are denoted by the marker next to the panel components.

In the following sections the different procedures in the whole processing protocol will be presented and described. The NUS reconstruction will be discussed <a href="reconstructionmethods.html">here</a>.
