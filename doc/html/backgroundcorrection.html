<hr>


<p>
The background or baseline correction follows the combination of the different HYSCORE signals at different τ-values. The correction of the 2D-background is performed sequentially. First the baselines of the single 1D-traces are corrected along one dimension and then repeated along the other.</p>

<p>
To each trace along a first dimension, a model is fitted and then subtracted to each of them. Next, another model is fitted to the traces along the second dimension and again subtracted. The order in which the background is corrected can be inverted by enabling the <code>Invert correction</code> sequence option. The background models available in Hyscorean are:</p>
</p>

<p>
The model to fit along each dimension can be selected under the <code>Background correction</code> section. For each model the dimensionality parameter n can be given in the <code>Polynomial Order</code>, <code>Exponential Order</code> or <code>Fractal Dimension</code> edit box next to the model list:

The background if fitted to the whole trace starting from the first point. However, the point at which the model starts to be fitted can be adjusted manually from the <code>Background start</code> edit boxes: </p>

<p>
For complex-valued signals the background correction is performed separately for the real and imaginary parts of the signal. Prior to background corrections the phase of the signal is quickly optimized such that the real component is maximized with respect to the imaginary component. At the start of the background correction the signal components are separated and to each of them a background is fitted and corrected along both dimensions. The real and imaginary parts are then combined back into the complex-valued background-corrected signal.

<p>
For uniform sampled HYSCORE data this represents the end of the pre-processing and leads to the start of the signal processing.
